[![Build and Deploy](https://github.com/sebi364/schnupperlehre/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/sebi364/schnupperlehre/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This repository contains the source files for a [JupyterLite](https://github.com/jupyterlite) environment, providing our "Schnupperlernende" (trial learners) with a convenient place to explore Python.

## Access the JupyterLite Site
The JupyterLite site is hosted as a static site with GitHub Pages and can be accessed through the following links:
* [https://sebi364.github.io/schnupperlehre/lab/index.html](https://sebi364.github.io/schnupperlehre/lab/index.html)
* [Shortened URL: t.ly/jgXXZ](https://t.ly/jgXXZ)

## Note
The exercises on the site are not intended to provide a complete course on Python. They are designed to give a short introduction and are accompanied by a matching presentation.
